# VisitorPatternDemo-NetworkSignalStrength
Visitor Design Pattern lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which the visitor class operates.
This example shows how to use Visitor Pattern to solve a network signal strength retrieval problem on Android devices, which not only achieves concern separation via loose coupling but also successfully avoids using a series of If-Else and instanceOf clauses as shown in Function getCellularSignalStrength_notRecommended() in NetworkInfo class.

This Andorid Application project demostrates the advantages of using Visitor Pattern along with Java Generics concept, which makes the task of adding new algorithms to the existing module become incredibly easy. 
Precisely, for the case we need to define a new algorithm to handle a new CellInfo subclass in the future, we just need to create a new "actual visitor" class and add the algorithm into it then modify function getActualVisitor() of CellInfoVisitor class to return the corresponding CellInfo instance if the passed-in class matches.
